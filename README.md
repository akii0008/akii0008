### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I don't use GitHub very much anymore-- you should instead look on [my Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/akii0008)-- but here's some basic information about me:

#### Personal info
* I am a high school graduate who is taking a a gap year
* I am from Philadelphia
* I use he/him pronouns
* I have been programming since 2017

#### Languages
* JavaScript is my playground. It is also where I write many of my projects. I mainly use node.js
* Java is my first strongly-typed language, and I must say I love it. I was "forced" to learn it because of a computer science class, and I've found that types are very useful.
* Because of Java, I've taken an interest in TypeScript. It seems to be pretty cool so far.
* I will occasionally dabble in Python. It's pretty easy to write, although I am not as proficient in it as I am with Javascript.
* I've written an app or two with pure HTML/CSS, although recently I've been looking into React.js/Next.js, which I've found to be quite useful.

#### Projects
* Anything here is very outdated. You'll want to find me on Gitlab instead: https://gitlab.com/akii0008
